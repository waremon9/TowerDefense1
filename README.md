# TowerDefense1
Created a tower defense in a week as a school project.

Place tower and defend against waves of ennemie.
Grow stronger buy upgrading your tower.
5 tower types.
(space to start new wave)

This is the content of the Assets folder for a Unity project. Mainly a personnal repo so there probably wont be a .exe here. If you really want to try it, make it yourself.(sry)
